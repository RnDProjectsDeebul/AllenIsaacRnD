    \chapter{Conclusions}

    \section{Contributions}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identified crucial problems and areas of concern
        \item Performed comparative evaluation of some of the properties.
        \item Propose some suggestions.

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Lessons learned}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cause of issues
        \item Where all failure can happen
        \item Can object constrain improve the mapping?
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Future work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation of additional constraints like orb points, planes, objects, and lines.
        \item Creation of digital twin using CAD model for each object.
        \item Improved localization using the knowledge of the objects.
        \item Improved localization based on textual detection.
        \item Autonomous navigation for SLAM based on exploration and exploitation rather than manual control.
        \item Performing semantic SLAM in an environment with unknown objects.
    \end{itemize}
